## Overview
Welcome to the Dice Challenge App! This application allows users to roll dice, specify the type and quantity of dice to roll, view the outcomes, and calculate the total value of all dice rolled. Additionally, users can roll an extra dice after the initial roll and reset the dice to start again. In the settings modal, users can also add a second dice and adjust the number of sides on each die, limited to values between one and six.

## Features
The app comes with the following features:

Roll Dice: Users can specify the type and quantity of dice to roll and then roll them to see the outcomes.

Outcome Display: Users can view the outcomes of the rolled dice, showing the individual results of each roll.

Total Value: The app calculates and displays the total value of all dice rolled so far.

Extra Dice Roll: Users have the option to roll an extra dice after the initial roll, adding an element of chance.

Reset Function: Users can reset the dice and start a new session.

Settings Modal: Users can access a settings modal to configure additional options, including adding a second dice and adjusting the number of sides on each die.

Double Six Notification: If a user scores a double six, they will receive a notification through an alert.
